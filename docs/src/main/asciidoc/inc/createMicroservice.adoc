= Create a microservice via the console

The easiest way to configure the Pipeline for your project is via the link:http://fabric8.io/guide/console.html[fabric8 developer console].

When you open the fabric8 console you should see a screen like this:

A `Team` is a kubernetes namespace running your development tools (like Jenkins, Nexus, JBoss Forge) and is associated with a number of environments (Testing, Staging, Production etc).

Click on the `Team Dashboard` which should take you to the Team Dashboard where you can create new apps or view your existing apps:

If you click the `Create Application` you get to the create wizard page:

Then you get to pick what kind of project you wish to create and its name:

Then choose your link:cdelivery.html[CD Pipeline]:

If you choose `Copy pipeline to project` then the Jenkinsfile that defines the pipeline gets copied into your project's git repository so that you can easily edit it later on via a versioned source code change just like any other code change.

Now you will be taken to the `App Dashboard` where you can see all the environments and active pipelines along with recent commits on a single pane of glass. This is how it looks once the Canary release, Testing and Staging is complete; waiting for Promotion to Production

You can click on the `Proceed` button to promote to Production, or `Abort` to stop the pipeline.

You can easily switch between all your development tools (Gogs, Jenkins, Nexus etc) using the tool drop down menu at the top right of the screen:

=== Runtime tabs

The `Team` page has a `Runtime` tab that lets you browse the runtime of your development environment. Or from the home page you can click on an environment page to view its runtime.

The `Runtime` pages have a number of tabs that let you work with the various Kubernetes resources. We'll highlight the main ones you'll need to use:

==== Replicas

The main tab to get a feel for what's running in your system is the *Replicas* tab which shows all the link:replicationControllers.html[replication controllers] or ReplicaSets on Kubernetes.

To scale up or down a controller to run more or less link:pods.html[pods] (containers) just increase or decrease the *Desired Replicas* value and hit *Save* and hey presto pods are created or destroyed.

==== Overview

The *Overview* tab gives you a feel for how all the various link:services.html[services] and link:replicationControllers.html[replication controllers] interact:
